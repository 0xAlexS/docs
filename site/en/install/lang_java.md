# Install TensorFlow Java

[TensorFlow Java](https://github.com/tensorflow/java) can run on any JVM for building, training and 
running machine learning models. It comes with a series of utilities and frameworks that help achieve 
most of the tasks common to data scientists and developers working in this domain. Java and other JVM 
languages, such as Scala or Kotlin, are frequently used in small-to-large enterprises all over the world, 
which makes TensorFlow a strategic choice for adopting machine learning at a large scale.

Caution: The TensorFlow Java API is *not* covered by the TensorFlow
[API stability guarantees](../guide/versions.md).

## Requirements

TensorFlow Java runs on Java 8 and above, and supports out-of-the-box the following platforms:

* Ubuntu 16.04 or higher; 64-bit, x86
* macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or higher; 64-bit, x86
* Windows 7 or higher; 64-bit, x86

*Note: To use TensorFlow on Android, see [TensorFlow Lite](https://tensorflow.org/lite)*

## Installing with Maven

To include TensorFlow in your [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) application, you first need to add in
your project's `pom.xml` file a dependency on a `tensorflow-core-platform` artifact.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>tensorflow-core-platform${extension}</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
You can leave the `extension` variable empty to use a vanilla version of TensorFlow or set it to one
of the supported variant:
* `-mkl`: Support for Intel速 MKL-DNN on all platforms
* `-gpu`: Support for CUDA速 on Linux and Windows platforms
* `-mkl-gpu`: Support for Intel速 MKL-DNN and CUDA速 on Linux and Windows platforms.

Optionally, you can also add a dependency to the `tensorflow-framework` library, which provides a rich
set of high-level utilities to improve the developer experience with machine learning on the JVM.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
  <artifactId>tensorflow-framework</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Reducing Number of Dependencies with Maven

It is important to note that adding a dependency to a `tensorflow-core-platform` artifact will import native 
libraries for all supported platforms, which can increase significantly the size of your project.

When it is already known that your project will only run on a subset of the supported platforms, it is possible
to exclude the artifacts of other platforms using the [Maven Dependency Exclusion](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-optional-and-excludes-dependencies.html#dependency-exclusions) feature.

Another way to specify which platform you want to include is to use JavaCPP platforms properties directly
in your Maven command line. Please see JavaCPP [documentation](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/wiki/Reducing-the-Number-of-Dependencies)
for more details.


### Using Snapshots

TensorFlow Java is also available as snapshots, which reflects that latest changes of the 
[TensorFlow Java Repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/java). To depend on these artifacts, 
you need to make sure that [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) Snapshots repository is 
configured in your `pom.xml` as well:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>tensorflow-snapshots</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
        <artifactId>tensorflow-core-platform</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Installing with Gradle

Same dependencies as with Maven can be added to your Gradle project to run TensorFlow. 
```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.tensorflow', name: 'tensorflow-core-platform', version: '0.2.0'
}
```
Please read the [Maven](#installing-with-maven) section for more details on the different artifacts that can be included.

### Reducing Number of Dependencies

Excluding native artifacts from TensorFlow Java with Gradle is not as easy as with Maven. We recommend that you use 
Gradle JavaCPP plugins to reduce the number of dependencies. Please read at Gradle JavaCPP 
[documentation](https://github.com/bytedeco/gradle-javacpp) for more details.

## Installing from Sources

To build TensorFlow Java from sources and possibly customize it, please read the following 
[instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/java/blob/master/README.md#building-sources). 

Please also note that only official builds distributed by TensorFlow are supported by its maintainers and custom builds should be used at the user's risk.

# Example Program

This example shows how to build an Apache Maven project with TensorFlow. First,
add the TensorFlow dependency to the project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>org.myorg</groupId>
    <artifactId>hellotensorflow</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <properties>
	<!-- Minimal version for compiling TensorFlow Java is JDK 8 -->
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
    </properties>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
            <artifactId>tensorflow-core-platform</artifactId>
            <version>0.2.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
```

Create the source file `src/main/java/HelloTensorFlow.java`:

```java
import org.tensorflow.ConcreteFunction;
import org.tensorflow.Signature;
import org.tensorflow.Tensor;
import org.tensorflow.TensorFlow;
import org.tensorflow.op.Ops;
import org.tensorflow.op.core.Placeholder;
import org.tensorflow.op.math.Add;
import org.tensorflow.types.TInt32;

public class HelloTensorFlow {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Running on TensorFlow " + TensorFlow.version());

    try (ConcreteFunction dbl = ConcreteFunction.create(HelloTensorFlow::dbl);
        Tensor<TInt32> x = TInt32.scalarOf(10);
        Tensor<TInt32> dblX = dbl.call(x).expect(TInt32.DTYPE)) {
      System.out.println("Double of " + x.data().getInt() + " is " + dblX.data().getInt());
    }
  }

  private static Signature dbl(Ops tf) {
    Placeholder<TInt32> x = tf.placeholder(TInt32.DTYPE);
    Add<TInt32> dblX = tf.math.add(x, x);
    return Signature.builder().input("x", x).output("dbl", dblX).build();
  }
}
```

Compile and execute:

<pre class="devsite-terminal prettyprint lang-bsh">
mvn -q compile exec:java
</pre>

The command outputs: 
```
Running on TensorFlow 2.3.1
Double of 10 is 20
```

Success: TensorFlow Java is configured.
